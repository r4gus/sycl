CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:8 (find_package):
  By not providing "FindQt5Qml.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "Qt5Qml", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "Qt5Qml" with any
  of the following names:

    Qt5QmlConfig.cmake
    qt5qml-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "Qt5Qml" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "Qt5Qml_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "Qt5Qml"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
